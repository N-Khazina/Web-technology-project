    <h1>Avoiding and Heal from diseases</h1>
    <h3>Make healthy food choices. “For good health and disease prevention, avoid ultra-processed foods and eat homemade meals
    prepared with basic ingredients,” says Dr. Todorov.

    other developed nation,” says Dr. Todorov.</h3>
    <h1>Diet and nutrition</h1>
    <h3>To start a healthy diet, replace unhealthy, processed foods high in sugar and fat with healthier alternatives like whole
    grains, fruits, and vegetables. Since this can be challenging, ease into it by replacing one food each week instead of
    cutting everything out at once.</h3>
    <h1>Mental health</h1>
    <h3>Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It influences cognition, perception, and
    behavior. It also determines how an individual handles stress, interpersonal relationships, and decision-making. Mental
    health includes subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and
    self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others. From the perspectives of positive
    psychology or holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between
    life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and
    competing professional theories all affect how one defines "mental health". Some early signs related to mental health
    problems are sleep irritation, lack of energy and thinking of harming yourself or others.<br></h3>
